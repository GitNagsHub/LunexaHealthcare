## Step 2: Gmail Setup

### Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

### Generate App Password
1. In Google Account Security, go to "App passwords" section
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Generate a new 16-character app password
4. Copy this password (you'll need it for the .env file)

## Step 3: Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
PORT=3000
```

**Important:** 
- Use your actual Gmail address for `nags.sellaiah@gmail.com`
